# NOTE: `runit` requires the service to run in the foreground.  However, `map`
# needs to run as a daemon if we are going to have more than one `map` instance
# servicing requests.  `fghack` is therefore used to keep the daemon running in
# the foreground.  See "How can I supervise a daemon that puts itself into the
# background?" at <http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/faq/create.html#fghack> for
# further information.  `/sbin/setuser www-data` runs the given command as the
# user `www-data`.  If you omit that part, the command will be run as root.
