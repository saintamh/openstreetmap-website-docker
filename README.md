# OpenStreetMap Website Docker Container

This repository contains instructions for building a
[Docker](https://www.docker.io/) image containing the
[openstreetmap-website](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website)
(aka The Rails Port) and associated software stack.

As well as providing an easy way to set up and run the website and OSM API
software it also provides instructions for managing OSM databases, allowing you
to:

* Creating OSM databases
* Migrating OSM databases
* Importing OSM data into the database
* Drop databases

Run `docker run -it homme/openstreetmap-website` for usage instructions.

## About

The container runs Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) and is based on the
[phusion/baseimage-docker](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker). It
includes:

* Postgresql 9.5
* Apache 2.4 with Phusion Passenger
* The latest Rails Port (at the time of image creation)
* The latest CGIMap code (at the time of image creation)

The Rails Port is set up by default to run in a 'production' environment.

## Issues

Please
[submit issues](https://github.com/geo-data/openstreetmap-website-docker/issues)
on GitHub. This is a work in progress and although generally adequate it could
benefit from:

* Testing.
* Including support for the
  [high speed GPX importer](http://git.openstreetmap.org/gpx-import.git/).
* Tweaking postgresql for large data imports.

This won't be an exhaustive list and pull requests are welcome!
